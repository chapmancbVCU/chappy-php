# User Profiles

## User Profile Home
The profile page can be accessed by clicking your name or profile image at the top right of any page.

The user profile contains basic information for a user. You can add fields to the users table and more information to this view depending on your needs. Make sure you don't display personal and financial information in this view without taking proper security measures to obscure information.

This view presents to the user the ability to update profile, profile image, and their password. The default layout for this view is shown below in Figure 1.
